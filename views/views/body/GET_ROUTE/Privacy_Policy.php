                    <div class="mt-4">
                    Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) provides that California residents, when making a verifiable consumer request, may request that a business subject to the law that collects consumer personal information to give consumers access, in a portable (if feasible) readily usable form, to the specific items and categories of personal information that business has collected about the consumer, the categories of sources for that information, the business purposes for collecting the information, and the categories of 3rd parties with which consumer information is shared.  California residents may submit a request for deletion of information. We will never charge you or provide services of less quality if you choose to exercise your rights under the CCPA, unless the deletion of information at your request impairs our ability to provide those services.
